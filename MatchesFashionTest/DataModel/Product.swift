    // and the lack of a formal specification for the data format.

    // Also, another reason for decoding the JSON directly is that in this app specs I
    // don't need to keep the various parts of a product separated into different dictionaries
    // as they are in the JSON string.
    //
    // This approach has the characteristic that if a product dictionary does not contain all the
    // required keys the product is discarded. This could be either a good or a bad thing.
    // In a real application this would have to be considered.

    // In a real world situation I would try to agree on a data format with the server devs
    // and switch Product to a Decodable object and rely on their own tests to make sure
    // that the data returned by the server conforms to that format.
